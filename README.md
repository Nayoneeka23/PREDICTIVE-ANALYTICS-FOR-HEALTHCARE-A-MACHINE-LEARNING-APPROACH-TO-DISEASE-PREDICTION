Heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality globally, necessitating improved diagnostic methods. This paper explores various machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD). ML can analyze vast patient data, identifying patterns to predict heart disease risk. Studies reviewed include algorithms like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression, with Random Forest achieving 100% accuracy. Another study using neural networks and regression methods reached 99.1% accuracy. Ensemble techniques also improved accuracy to 95%. Feature selection and cross-validation are highlighted as crucial for model accuracy and robustness. The paper advocates for ML's potential to revolutionize heart disease diagnosis, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize models, integrate medical imaging, and ensure responsible healthcare deployment.
